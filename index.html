            authority and responsibility.Election is a formal group decision making the process. The selected political

        <h1 class="characteristic-title">Characteristics of an Election</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="characteristic-content">The right to vote in elections is important part of Election. The
                question in everyone mind will be who may vote. In India the voters should be 18 plus age.</li>
            <li class="characteristic-content">The nomination of a candidate is an important characteristic of Election.
                This means to officially suggest someone for Election. Nomination refers to the process of selecting a
                candidate for election to a public office. Endorsements or Testimonials are public statements to support
                a candidate’s nomination.</li>
            <li class="characteristic-content">Electoral systems is another characteristic of Election. Electoral
                systems refer to detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems. Detailed constitutional
                arrangements and voting systems convert the vote into a political decision.</li>
            <li class="characteristic-content">The first step is the tally of votes. For this purpose, there is the use
                of various vote counting systems and ballot. Then comes the determination of the result on the basis of
                the tally. The categorization of most systems is as either proportional or majoritarian.</li>
            <li class="characteristic-content">Scheduling refers to arranging and controlling of Elections. Elected
                officials are accountable to the people. Therefore, they must return to the voters at regular intervals
                of time. Elected officials must do that so as to seek a mandate to continue in office. Most countries
                arrange elections at fixed regular intervals.</li>
            <li class="characteristic-content">An election campaign is also an integral part of Election. Election
                campaign refers to an organized effort to positively influence the decision making of a particular
                group. Consequently, politicians compete with each other by trying to woo more and more individuals.

        <h1 class="importance-title">Importance of Election</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="importance-content">The Election is a peaceful and efficient way of choosing political leaders.
                Citizens of a Nation choose a leader by casting their votes. In this way, the citizens are able to
                choose an individual whose views appeal to them most. Hence, people are able to exercise their will in
                political leadership.</li>
            <li class="importance-content">An election is an excellent opportunity for people to express their
                resentment. If people are unhappy with a particular leadership, then they can remove it from power.
                People can certainly replace an undesirous leadership with a better alternative through Election.</li>
            <li class="importance-content">The election is a handsome opportunity for political participation. It is a
                way by which new issues can be raised in public. In most democratic countries, common citizens are
                allowed to contest elections independently.</li>
            <li class="importance-content">A citizen could introduce reforms which are not any political party’s agenda.
                Also, in most democratic countries, a citizen could form a new political party to contest Election.</li>
            <li class="importance-content">Election helps keep the power of political leaders in check. The ruling
                parties cannot afford to do any wrong doing to the public due to the risk of losing Election. Hence,
                Election serves as an efficient power check and control for those in the ruling power.</li>
            <li class="importance-content">Election is the symbol of political freedom. It is the tool which puts
                authority in the hands of common people. Democracy certainly would be non-functional without it. People
                must realize the value of Elections and come out in large numbers to vote.</li>
